# channels-tests-refactoring-kata

This is a refactoring kata that focuses on refactoring the test code rather than production code.

The idea is to improve the readability of the 'arrange' part of the tests in branch 'main', to use
the Test Data Builder pattern. The starting point already has some examples of the pattern, which
should give you inspiration to add more builders.

# TODO
- formulate learning goals
- formulate learning hour 4C structure
- try again after the code is refactored
